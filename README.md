Assume you are an embedded engineer tasked with designing a smart environmental monitoring system. To ensure the project is well-r ganized and all components are accounted for, prepare a table listing the components, the functions, estimated costs, and the microcontroller (MCU) to be used.

Requirements:

1. List all sensors and components needed for monitoring various environmental parameters.

2. Include the type of communication interfaces.

3. Specify the power supply requirements.

4. Identify a suitable microcontroller.

5. Provide estimated costs for each component.
